1. run 'npm install', to install all the newly added dependacies.

4. To start the client server, use 'yarn start'. 
    (Make sure to start your server first as it is set to port 3000,

5. Check out the '.env' file and fill it with your information.

6. Go to the 'client/src/variables.js' and confirm your server path,
    change it if it varies.

Note: I left a phone number in the '.env' server file,
    that is the only number you can use in test mode.
    Although, you don't receive the message, you get a 'sid' back.
    If you want to receive the message, you'd have to buy a phone number from them.
